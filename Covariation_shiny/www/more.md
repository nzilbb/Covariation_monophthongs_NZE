**Run app locally**

Shinyapps.io is currently hosting the app and has usage limits meaning there can be issues when using it from this url.

You can also run the app locally using the following R code (note you need the `shiny` package installed in R, you can do this by `install.packages("shiny")`):

```
library(shiny)

runUrl( "https://nzilbb.github.io/Covariation_monophthongs_NZE/Covariation_shiny.zip")
```
